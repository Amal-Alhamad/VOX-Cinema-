# VOX Cinema Website Project

This is a project developed by our group as part of a course on Web Development and we used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. It features a homepage with available movies, movie detail pages, and user registration form. 
The purpose of this project is to apply the concepts we learned during the course and demonstrate our skills in building a simple website.
